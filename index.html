<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a political scientist and head of the Department of Industrial Change at the <a href="https://www.arbeit-umwelt.de">Stiftung Arbeit und Umwelt (Foundation for Labour and the Environment)</a>, the sustainability think tank of the German Mining, Chemical and Energy Industries Union (IGBCE). My objective is to facilitate a just and sustainable industrial transformation towards a greenhouse gas neutral economy from a industrial labour perspective.</p> 

My previous roles include positions as a researcher at the <a href="https://www.dzsf.bund.de">German Centre for Rail Traffic Research (DZSF)</a>, as senior advisor at the <a href="http://www.boeckler.de">Hans Böckler Foundation</a> and as researcher and adjunct lecturer at the <a href="http://www.uni-due.de/politik">University of Duisburg-Essen</a> and the <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> in Cleve. In addition, I have received training in diversity orientated career coaching, peer coaching and in solution focused counselling.</p>

<p>From 2018-2021 I was a postdoctoral researcher and project manager for the <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/386268084">DFG</a> research project <a href="https://eufoot.github.io">The Identity Effect of Europeanised Lifeworlds</a> at the<a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> and the <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de">University of Mainz</a>. I initiated the follow-up project <a href="https://fanzine-research.github.io">FANZinE - Football as a basis for social cohesion in Europe</a> (2021-2024), which I have accompanied as a scientific advisor.

<p>I have a background in political science and history, having studied at the universities of Aachen, Prague and Potsdam. I obtained my PhD from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Duisburg-Essen, where my research focused on <a href="https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00043836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf" target=_blank>young people in established political structures</a> (supervised by <a href="http://achimgoerres.de">Prof. Dr Achim Goerres</a>).</p>
